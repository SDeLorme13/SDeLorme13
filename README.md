# Hey there, I'm Spencer DeLorme! 👋

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I'm a recent Data Science graduate from **UNC Charlotte** (Go Niners! Class of May '25 🎓) based in the Charlotte, NC area. I'm passionate about untangling complex problems, whether that involves diving into data, building cool tech solutions, or figuring out the logistics behind a major event.

### A Bit About My Journey 🚀

For the past decade or so, I've been on a bit of an entrepreneurial ride. I co-founded and helped run a couple of unique businesses:

* **Stellar Appearances:** Managing bookings and providing white-glove, hands-on service for celebrity appearances at conventions and events. It's been a wild world of logistics, client relations, and making sure everything runs smoothly under pressure!
* **HorrorAutographs.com:** This was my dive into e-commerce, building an online retail space for horror movie and TV memorabilia from the ground up. Lots of learning about online platforms, inventory, and reaching a niche audience.
* I also had a stint with **The Wealth Solutions Group**, where I got to help a financial services firm build out its initial digital presence and streamline some of its financial calculations with some nifty Excel work.

### Current Explorations & What I'm Tinkering With 🛠️

Right now, I'm pretty immersed in a personal project I'm calling the **Multi‑Purpose Encrypted USB Ecosystem**. It's a five-drive USB toolkit I've been engineering that includes:
* A fully encrypted, GPU-accelerated Ubuntu data-science workstation (with a portable VirtualBox clone).
* A Ventoy-based "Swiss Army" recovery stick with various security/forensic toolsets (including Kali Linux for exploration).
* An encrypted vault for datasets/models and secure file exchange.

It's been a fantastic learning experience in Linux, encryption, scripting, and just seeing how much utility you can pack into a portable setup.

### Tech & Tools I Enjoy Working With 💻

* **Languages & Scripting:** Python (especially with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn), SQL(learning), SAS and a bit of R.
* **Data & Analysis:** Excel (I actually enjoy making complex spreadsheets work!), Data Cleaning, Statistical Modeling, Predictive Analytics (like ARIMA), Feature Engineering, Data Visualization.
* **OS & Environments:** Linux (Ubuntu, Mint, Kali & Cinnamon), Windows 8.1 - Windows 10.
* **Security & Utilities:** Encryption tools (LUKS2, VeraCrypt), Virtualization (VirtualBox), Git/GitHub, Ventoy.
* **Business Tools:** MS Office 365, Google Workspace.

### Beyond the Keyboard 🎧🚗🏌️‍♂️

When I'm not wrangling data or tinkering with tech:
* You'll probably find me deep in an **EDM** track – I love finding patterns in music, and it's been a passion of mine since 2012.
* I'm a bit of a **car enthusiast**, especially Mustangs (owned a couple!).
* I enjoy a round of **golf** when I can or a trip to the driving range – great way to clear the head.
* I've spent a lot of time **traveling for business** over the years, so I'm pretty comfortable navigating new places.
